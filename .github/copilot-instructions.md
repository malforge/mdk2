⚠️ **BRANCH SAFETY WARNING**: Before starting ANY work session, check the current git branch. If on "main" or "prerelease" branches, IMMEDIATELY warn the user and ask if they want to create/switch to a feature branch. These are protected branches that should not receive direct commits during development.
