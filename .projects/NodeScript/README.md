# NodeScript

A node-based visual programming interface for building Space Engineers programmable block scripts.

## Project Overview

NodeScript aims to provide a visual, node-based editor that allows users to create programmable block scripts without writing code directly. The system will generate MDK2-compatible C# scripts from the visual node graph.

## Goals

- Visual node-based script construction
- Generate valid programmable block C# code
- Integration with MDK2 packaging pipeline
- Support common Space Engineers API patterns

## Status

**Planning Phase** - Long-term project

## Notes

This folder contains project planning, design documents, and development notes for NodeScript.
