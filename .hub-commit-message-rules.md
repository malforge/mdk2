# Hub Commit Message Rules

## Guidelines
- **Check uncommitted changes first**: Always review `git status` and `git diff` to see what's actually changed
- **User-facing**: Describe what changed from the user's perspective
- **Short subject line**: Keep the first line concise (under 72 chars)
- **Brief body**: Commit body should be 1-3 sentences. If you write more than 100 words, you're being too verbose.
- **Multi-line for complex changes**: Use bullets to list multiple related improvements
- **No implementation details**: Avoid technical jargon, class names, method names, file paths
- **No file listings**: Don't list which files were changed - that's what the diff shows
- **Focus on capabilities, not components**: Describe the feature, not the parts that make it work
  - ✅ "Add new project creation dialog"
  - ❌ "Add new project creation dialog with name input, location selector, icon display, and path preview"
  - The user doesn't need to know about every UI element - they just care that they can create projects
- **Don't describe how new features work**: If a feature is being added, just say what it does, not its implementation details
  - ✅ "Add configuration repair tool"
  - ❌ "Configuration drawer closes automatically after normalization completes"
  - Users have no prior context for features that didn't exist before - they don't need to know the UX flow
- **Comprehensive**: Cover all relevant uncommitted changes, not just recent work

## Good Examples

### Single feature commits
- "Add build notification preferences"
- "Fix project list refresh losing selection"
- "Improve unsaved changes handling"

### Multi-feature commits
```
Fix project navigation and improve path handling reliability

- Project navigation now scrolls correctly when triggered from dialogs
- Path comparisons now work reliably across Windows and Linux
- Fixed project overview not loading from saved state
```

### Removal commits
```
Remove CheckDotNet command line application

The standalone CheckDotNet tool has been superseded by the Hub's built-in .NET 
detection. Removed from packagers and build workflow.
```

## Bad Examples
- ❌ "Add Interactive property to ConfigurationSectionViewModel with InteractiveOptionsList"
- ❌ "Implement state-preserving refresh by reusing existing ProjectModel instances"
- ❌ "Update ProjectService.SaveConfiguration signature to include interactive parameter"
- ❌ "Eliminates the Windows-specific checkdotnet.exe tool that checked for .NET SDK availability before builds. This check was redundant since the Hub already performs comprehensive .NET detection via UpdateCheckService.CheckDotNetSdkAsync(). Removed CheckDotNet execution from Mdk.PbPackager and Mdk.ModPackager build props files. Projects will now proceed directly to MDK restore/pack operations. Removed CheckDotNet build and artifact deployment from GitHub Actions workflow..."
  - Too verbose - says the same thing multiple times in different ways
