v.2.1.5
   - Can find path to IngameScripts on Linux automatically now.

v.2.1.4
   - Now supports a Content folder in the mod folder, instead of copying everything from the root. This update is
     not breaking, as the project file still determines what the content files are, but any new projects created
     from the updated template will use the new folder structure.

v.2.1.2
   - Mod packing: When copying mixin code, relative paths (..\ etc) were not forced into the mod folder.

v.2.1.1
   - Missing files, missing files, missing files... Microsoft, you'll end me.

v.2.1.0
   - DotNet 9 Compatibility _for real_ this time... and also a little less iffy for the .net 8 users (they'll be told
     to update rather than just crash).
   - Mod Packer is now available: Use `mdk2 pack` to pack your mod for distribution the same way you can pack your 
     scripts. Note this is currently rather experimental.

   - Now removing `private` and `internal` access modifiers where they are redundant.

v.2.0.6
   - Fixed a problem where a quirk in Roslyn behavior for indexers would cause a compile error after minification.
   - Added the missing <mdk sortorder="#"/> feature.

v.2.0.5

 - Fixed a problem where the full minifier did not rename catch clause variables
 - Fixed a problem where the full minifier would rename references to protected symbols
