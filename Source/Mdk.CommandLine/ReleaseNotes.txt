v.2.2.0-pre.1
   - Introducing MDK Hub: A visual application for managing projects, checking for updates, and configuring settings.
   - Interactive mode now integrates with the Hub for build notifications and updates.
   - Cross-platform support for Windows and Linux.

v.2.1.17
   - Moved the "Smallifier" processor to the Trim minifying level.

v.2.1.16
   - `MinifierLevel=none` would still trim code. Now we early exit TypeTrimmer if `MinifierLevel=none`.
   - replacements would replace unknown keys with nothing. Now unknown keys f.ex. `$UNMATCHED$` is left alone.
   - `abstract class Base { public abstract void Tick(); } class Derived : Base { public override void Tick() {} }` - base abstract member could be removed even though it must exist for the override.
   - `class Base { public Base() { /* side effects */ } } class Derived : Base {}` - base parameterless ctor could be trimmed even though derived types call it implicitly.
   - `class Registrar { static readonly int _x = Register(); int P { get; } = Register(); }` - side‑effecting field/property initializers could be removed.
   - `class Factory<T> where T : new() { T Create() => new T(); } var f = new Factory<A>();` - A’s parameterless ctor could be removed even though `new()` requires it.

v.2.1.15
   - Fix hardcoded paths causing issues on Linux due to relative paths using '.\' on Mod Packer

v.2.1.14
   - Extended dead code removal to also remove: methods, fields, properties, delegates besides just entirely unused types. An extra option in mdk.ini, minifyextraoptions, allows you to opt out from trimming.

v.2.1.13
   - Extended macro replacements such as "$MDK_DATETIME$" to work everywhere in scripts and mods, and not just in mdk regions like "#region mdk preserve"

v.2.1.12
   - Fixed a dum-dum error causing just the project filename to be passed down rather than the full path, causing the project file to not be found. PSA: There's no such thing as "just a small harmless fix". Test your code.

v.2.1.11
   - Changed: ini files are now exposed as AdditionalFiles to enable analyzer integration
   
v.2.1.10
   - LordMike added Compact field declarations in CodeSmallifier (combine separate variable declarations of the same type into multi-declaration)
   - LordMike fixed linq queries
   
v.2.1.9
   - Fixed 'mdk help pack' and 'mdk help restore' commands which were broken

v.2.1.8
   - Fix Issue #98: nameof() expressions not renamed with name conflicts
   - mdk.ini and mdk.local.ini are now primary file names rather than {project}.mdk.ini and {project}.mdk.local.ini

v.2.1.7
   - Added support for thumb formats other than png (ex: thumb.jpg, thumb.bmp, thumb.gif) to Script Packer.

v.2.1.6
   - Fixed minifier newline handling breaking when referencing minified code from preserved code.
   
v.2.1.5
   - Removed a bad compilation stage which caused custom namespace usings to fail a build rather than just being renoved.

v.2.1.4
   - Now supports a Content folder in the mod folder, instead of copying everything from the root. This update is
     not breaking, as the project file still determines what the content files are, but any new projects created
     from the updated template will use the new folder structure.

v.2.1.2
   - Mod packing: When copying mixin code, relative paths (..\ etc) were not forced into the mod folder.

v.2.1.1
   - Missing files, missing files, missing files... Microsoft, you'll end me.

v.2.1.0
   - DotNet 9 Compatibility _for real_ this time... and also a little less iffy for the .net 8 users (they'll be told
     to update rather than just crash).
   - Mod Packer is now available: Use `mdk2 pack` to pack your mod for distribution the same way you can pack your 
     scripts. Note this is currently rather experimental.

v.2.0.15
   - DotNet 9 Compatibility

v.2.0.14
   - Fixed a problem where references to nested types would be replaced by a "var" by the minifier.

v.2.0.13
   - Readded missing binaries

v.2.0.12
   - Fixed test that failed due to missing references. Attempt to clean up files that shouldn't be committed.
   - Update to gitignore
   - Fixed a problem where object-initializing a generic type would cause a compile error after minification.

v.2.0.11
   - Ignored documents were not always properly ignored in the project, which in certain rare cases could cause a 
     compile error.

v.2.0.10
   - Fixed nuget version checks not working properly.
   - Much improved qualified name handling in the minifier + leaving `var` as is.

v.2.0.9
   - Fixed #40: missing MSBuild instance just crashing MDK rather than giving a meaningful error message.
   - Fixed #42 verbatim variables was not renamed correctly in the minifier

v.2.0.8
   - Added symbol map generation to trace mode to help with debugging minification issues.
   - Fixed more problems with minifier not renaming things it should have and vice versa.

v.2.0.7
   - Fixed a problem where the minifier replaced a `var` with an incorrect type reference. Now leaving `var` as is.
   - Now removing `private` and `internal` access modifiers where they are redundant.

v.2.0.6
   - Fixed a problem where a quirk in Roslyn behavior for indexers would cause a compile error after minification.
   - Added the missing <mdk sortorder="#"/> feature.

v.2.0.5
    - Package was not defined as a development dependency

v.2.0.4
 - Reverted a convenience fix that caused more trouble than convenience...
 
v.2.0.3
 - Fixed a problem where references to generic methods would not be renamed with the full minifier.
 - Fixed a problem where delegates would not be renamed with the full minifier.
 - Intermediate code files are now written to the \obj folder when trace is enabled.
 
v.2.0.2
 - Fixed a problem where generic method declarations didn't get their generic parameters renamed with the full minifier.
 - Fixed a problem where the full minifier did not rename catch clause variables
 - Fixed a problem where the full minifier would rename references to protected symbols
 
v.2.0.1
 - Simplified how project properties are defined and used as their complexity was unnecessary.
 - Restore now checks the other packages for updates as well.

v.2.0.0
 - Official release of MDK2 (Programmable Block Edition)

v.2.0.0-alpha073
 - Minifiers Ahoy! (the two last major minifier components are now in place)

v.2.0.0-alpha072
 - Fixed a bug where references to sub-namespaces would cause compile errors. 

v.2.0.0-alpha061
 - Fixed warning about unusable minifier

v.2.0.0-alpha060
 - Wrong / confusing error message for a part of the minifier that isn't finished yet
  
v.2.0.0-alpha059
 - Fixed type trimmer removing types it shouldn't have, and vice versa.
  
v.2.0.0-alpha058
 - Fixed minifier specification being wrongly named in the package arguments (minifier instead of minify).

v.2.0.0-alpha057
 - Fixed minifier specification being wrongly named in the MDK2 command line (minifier instead of minify).

v.2.0.0-alpha056
 - Added the type trimmer minifier level to the MDK2 command line.
 - Added the comment removal minifier level to the MDK2 command line.

v.2.0.0-alpha054
 - Fixed an issue where the mdk2 .ini file ignores were made with ; as a separator rather than ,.

v.2.0.0-alpha052
 - Added a warning if the final composed script exceeds the maximum allowed character count of the programmable block.

v.2.0.0-alpha051
 - Final structure (I think) for MDK2 command line.
 - Now notifying when new nuget packages are available (currently just Mal.MDK2.PbPackager).
 - Changed to an .ini based configuration rather than an msbuild based one.
 - Added an auto-migrator to add MDK2 support to MDK1 projects.

v.2.0.0-alpha1
 - Emergency publish of a very early build due to the problems with MDK1 and the new version of Visual Studio 2022.
 - This version is highly untested, and is missing the minifier.
