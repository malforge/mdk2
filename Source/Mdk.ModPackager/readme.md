The game [Space Engineers](https://store.steampowered.com/app/244850/Space_Engineers/)
(by [Keen Software House](https://www.keenswh.com/), no affiliation) supports
scripting and modding using the C# language. This project allows modders to use full projects
for their mods, with separate code files and mixin (shared project) libraries, by reading
the projects and compiling them into a final mod the game can use.

_This package is part of the MDK2 project._
