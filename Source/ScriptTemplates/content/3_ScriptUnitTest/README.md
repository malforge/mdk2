# Getting Started

Before doing anything:
- Add a reference to the script project you want to test.
- Make sure your Program class is `public`.

This test project will neither compile nor run properly if you don't do this.

Take a look in Tests/InstancingTests.cs for some simple examples of how to write tests.
